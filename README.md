\section{What is the problem} Predicting higher values Time series data Example

The machine learning algorithms and statistical models have evolved tremendously along with the exponential advancement in the capacity of the computation power. Many models have been build developed and widely used. But because of the previous available research, which established the modus oparandi of the future direction, there are many serious lacks in the developed models.

Around AD 1700, when the regression was in primary stage, the scholars mostly focused on the developing and estimating the model w, revolve around the mean value. The later subsequent development led in deriving least square method and the conditional mean phenomenon was well established since then, which exhibits profound efficiency for predicting and analysing the pattern focused on mean, resulting in widespread use.

But while dealing with financial data, or natural calamities like flood, earthquake, disease prediction, crime rate etc, its not the mean behaviour which of our interest, but the extreme behaviour of such event. To model such pattern we need to execute the different methodology than the one base on the mean, called as parametric models. Using non-parametric models was never been a easy task given the tedious nature and the confusing interpretation. But it promised a good deal while addressing such extreme pattern.

\section{Why you} I was always fascinated by the predictive models in statistics, and have intensively studied it. It was quite apparent in my bachelor and master thesis, which both deal with predictive methodology, the later especially focused on computer vision. . Also, in my freelancing work I have assisted on several such project, which has enriched my exposure to wide range of data and the execution.

\section{What is the impact}

Such methodology promises a great deal of application in field which generates skewed data, including stock prediction, disease outbreak, natural disaster, meteriological data etc. Also, proposing a new models in non-parametric domain will give a foundation for developing the new statistical validation, like inference , hypothesis testing and evaluation metrics. Given the many facet application , dire need alternative methodody and to use avaialable computational capability, such models are the need of hour.
